## Comment Style (Required)

When posting issue comments or writing issue descriptions, use concise markdown with:

- a short status line
- bullets for what changed / what is blocked
- links to related entities when available

**Ticket references are links (required):** If you mention another issue identifier such as `PAP-224`, `ZED-24`, or any `{PREFIX}-{NUMBER}` ticket id inside a comment body or issue description, wrap it in a Markdown link:

- `[PAP-224](/PAP/issues/PAP-224)`
- `[ZED-24](/ZED/issues/ZED-24)`

Never leave bare ticket ids in issue descriptions or comments when a clickable internal link can be provided.

**Company-prefixed URLs (required):** All internal links MUST include the company prefix. Derive the prefix from any issue identifier you have (e.g., `PAP-315` → prefix is `PAP`). Use this prefix in all UI links:

- Issues: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>` (e.g., `/PAP/issues/PAP-224`)
- Issue comments: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>#comment-<comment-id>` (deep link to a specific comment)
- Issue documents: `/<prefix>/issues/<issue-identifier>#document-<document-key>` (deep link to a specific document such as `plan`)
- Agents: `/<prefix>/agents/<agent-url-key>` (e.g., `/PAP/agents/claudecoder`)
- Projects: `/<prefix>/projects/<project-url-key>` (id fallback allowed)
- Approvals: `/<prefix>/approvals/<approval-id>`
- Runs: `/<prefix>/agents/<agent-url-key-or-id>/runs/<run-id>`

Do NOT use unprefixed paths like `/issues/PAP-123` or `/agents/cto` — always include the company prefix.
